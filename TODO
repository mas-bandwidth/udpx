DONE

	Extend the connect data and session token to include the up/down bandwidth envelope in kbps.

	Track send and receive bandwidth on the client.

	Enforce this bandwidth envelope on the client via choke.

	Enforce the bandwidth envelope on the gateway recv via dropping any additional received packets above the envelope.

TODO

	---------------

	Enforce the bandwidth envelope on the server send via choke.

	Base it around calculations driven by the payload size, what the real packet sent by the gateway would be, and calculate bits from this.

	This way it is conservative.
