TODO

	Add packet type:

		0: payload
		1: challenge
		2. challenge response

	-------------

	Add session map with double buffered idea for automatic timeouts

	Initially, insert into session map without challenge/response, just to make sure that

	-------------

	Implement timeout on the client.go side, make it configurable, but initially setting to 10 seconds is fine.

	-------------

	Implement challenge token and test it

	-------------

	Actually hook up challenge/response protocol gating additions to the session map on the gateway.
