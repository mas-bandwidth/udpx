TODO

	-------------

	Implement challenge token and add unit tests for it

	Challenge token should be encrypted (not readable by client) and have:

		sequence
		timestamp 
		client address + port
		gateway address + port

	-------------

	The challenge packet should include the sequence that the challenge token was generated at, so the client can decide if the challenge packet is newer and update it.

	-------------

	Hook up the challenge token in the challenge/response protocol.

	This means including it in the challenge packet, and including the challenge token (encrypted) in the payload packet when it is set on the client.

	Once the client receives a payload packet from the server, with sequence > than the challenge seqeuence **IMPORTANT***

	Then the client may clear the challenge token.
