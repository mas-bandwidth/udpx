DONE

	Setup a soak test harness so I can test it with a bunch of clients running at the same time

	Server also needs the concept of payload id and payload acks

	The server should be setup such that there is a channel for payload sends per-session

	When the session entry recieves a packet, it non-blocking walks over payload channel and sends any pending payloads down to the client.

	There should also be a payload ack channel per-session, this should also get pumped after processing each packet from the session.

	The whole idea is to avoid O(n) walk and drive everything on the server from the actual packets being received

	This will slightly increase jitter (if the client has significant jitter), but it seems the best approach.

	I can't see a server scaling if it has to have an internal tick rate and it pumps out send packets to 1000s of clients every 1/n seconds, with the amount of contention between the threads.

TODO

	------------

	Add test for the get ack bits function

	Add test for the process acks function
