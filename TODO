DONE

	Expand the challenge packet to also have prefix and postfix.

	Verify client packet filters pass for challenge packets.

	Move as much the client packet filters pre-test to recv thread.

	Extend the client to ignore old payload packets by sequence.

	Added buffer of received packet sequence numbers to session map entry on server.

	It's much easier doing this with 64bit sequence numbers and no wrap...

TODO

	Extend the gateway to have a smaller sequence buffer (100 entries?) to drop packets already received.

	--------------------

	Extend GetAckBits to actually return ack bitfield

	Verify on client the ack bitfield comes down.

	Store acked packets in a sequence buffer on client.

	Write function to decode ack bitfield to actual acked packets.
