DONE

TODO

	Strategically, key things I can do next:

		1. C client

		2. UE4 integration

		3. Unity integration

		4. In broswer client (javascript w. WebRTC)

	Aligned with my current direction, the most important thing is a C client leading to UE4 integration.

	The next most important thing after that is the WebSockets implementation.

	Both will assist in developing an ABI and spec across multiple implementations.
