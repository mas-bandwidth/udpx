DONE

	Add packet types:

		0: payload
		1: challenge
		2. challenge response

	Add packet type to client -> gateway packet

	Handle the payload packet type by forwarding to server (todo, check for establish session w. gateway first...)

	Add session map with double buffered idea for automatic timeouts

	Initially, insert into session map without challenge/response, just to make sure that the idea works
