DONE

	Clean up client code and make the main loop totally separate from any sequence numbers in clients.

	The client needs to know what payloads get acked.

	This can be a separate sequence number, implicit, starting at 0 for each payload sent.

	Since bandwidth is not a serious concern, and scalability is, having a separate payload sequence
	from the packet sequence is viable, and enables better scaling -- if the sequence number for packets
	was exposed to the caller, it would create contention between threads when sending internal packets, 
	and payload packets on the protocol.

	Implement a payload ack channel, and push acks back down to the caller via it.

	Clean up code across client/gateway/server/core

TODO

	------------

	Add test for the get ack bits function

	Add test for the process acks function

	------------

	Setup a soak test harness so I can test it with a bunch of clients running at the same time

	------------

	I'd like to know the gateway id and the server id on the client.

	This way the client has some logs that indicate which gateway instance it is connected to.

	And then client session experiences can be tied to the gateway and server instances as it hops around.

	Without this, it will be almost impossible to see what happens to a client session, when debugging something wrong in production across multiple gateways and server instances.

	It seems the easiest way to do this is to extend the payload packet to include the server and gateway ids, when known.

	This also lets the gateway and server do some additional verification to see that this session does in fact belong to them, and do edge detection when a session migrates in from a different gateway, or to a different server instance.

	It seems that this edge detection is important.

	The client also will see that it connects to different gateways and servers as its session goes on.

	------------

	There should be a access token and a way for this token to be refreshed at some period, to maintain connectivity to the system.

	The gateway should just ignore any packets that don't have an up to date access token.

	Access tokens can just be included with every payload packet.

	Potentially, the client can avoid needing to update the access token entirely, if the server backend passes the updated token back down to the client every n seconds, this avoids the need to maintain additional connections.

	This is definitely desirable.

	------------

	Server also needs the concept of payload id and payload acks
