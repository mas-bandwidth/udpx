DONE

	Extend the connect data and session token to include the up/down bandwidth envelope in kbps.

	Track send and receive bandwidth on the client.

	Enforce this bandwidth envelope on the client via choke.

	Enforce the bandwidth envelope on the gateway recv via dropping any additional received packets above the envelope.

	Enforce the bandwidth envelope on the server send via choke.

	Base it around calculations driven by the payload size, what the real packet sent by the gateway would be, and calculate bits from this.

	This way it is conservative.

TODO

	What's the next step?

	Specify packets per-second via connect data, session token.

	Actually use this on the client to drive the rate of send.

	Enforce the send rate on the gateway for received packets (no more than the value + 10%...)

	Do not worry about the send rate on the server for now, since it is a reflector.

	-----------

	Add measurements of sent and received bandwidth on the client

	-----------

	Add measurements of packet loss, jitter, latency etc.

	-----------

	Extend the auth service to accept the user id passed in, and the packet send rate, and up/down envelopes.

	-----------

	Magic value service.

	-----------

	Key rotation.
