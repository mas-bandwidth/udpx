DONE

	Implement secret box primitives and write tests for them

	Sketch out challenge token contents

	Implement read/write challenge token

	Implement write encrypted challenge token

	Implement test for read/write challenge token

	Implement read encrypted challenge token

	Implement tests for read/write encrypted challenge token

TODO

	-------------

	Include an encrypted challenge token in the challenge packet, followed by the sequence number of the challenge token.

	-------------

	Client reads the challenge token in the challenge packet when received, and the sequence number of the challenge.

	If the client has no challenge token stored, OR, the challenge token has higher sequence number that the current challenge, the client should store the challenge token + sequence number as current.

	-------------

	When the client sends a payload packet to the gateway, if a challenge token exists, include it in the packet

	If no challenge token exists on the client, write a zero byte "no challenge token" at a point in the payload packet.

	-------------

	When the client receives a payload packet back from the server, with ack >= challenge token sequence, the client clears the challenge token.

	-------------

	Verify the client punches through challenge/response and gets payload packets in return.

	-------------

	Verify the client stops sending challenge responses once it punches through.
