# udpx

The year is 2035. Everybody has 10gbps internet. People regularly play games with experiences much larger than can be simulated on a single server.

What would the netcode look like?

UDPX is a thought experiment to see what the network protocol would be like 10 years from now.

A UDP-based protocol, but also bringing in ideas from backend systems like nginx and horizontally scalable web architectures.

Instead of supporting a single server instance, UDPX is intended to allow horizontal scaling for UDP-based applications, with microservices handling various aspects of the game simulation.

This is prototype software. Your feedback is appreciated.
